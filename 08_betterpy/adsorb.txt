TASK ALPHA!
Questions: How to change Justin's code into a function? Simpler way to read through Yaying's file (without looping through each character in a string)? If random int doesn't fall into a range, what happens? Based on other peers' codes, is the best way to solve this problem to find another random int and try again?
Comments: Nice use of floats and intervals, Justin. Interesting to see Yaying's code use randomchoices instead of other random methods. Yoonah's code similar to Justin's, really smart to multiply everything by 10 to avoid using decimals. Josh method of adding percentages repeatedly seems efficient! Overall, most people seem to use this "intervals" idea and random number methods. Most people also started out with similar ways to read the file and converting the contents to a dictionary.
Concerns: Justin's code should have been a function? 

TASK BETA!
We learned that $ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero would essentially just be creating a virtual environment inside the directory myherozero. If the directory doesnâ€™t exist it would be created otherwise it would be reused Venv stands for Virtual Environment. This is useful when dealing with importing libraries that more than one project is using but you need different versions of that library. A virtual environment allows you to use create different environments for each directory/project so you can import different libraries and versions for each project depending on what you need.
