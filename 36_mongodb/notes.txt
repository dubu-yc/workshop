- viewing/updating documents in the shell uses JSON (JavaScript Standard Object Notation)
- can have sub-documents (address example)
- JSON: friendly, readable, familiar but text-based (slow), space-consuming, limited data types it can support
- BSON (Binary JSON): bridge gap between binary representation and JSON format, bring up the shortcomings of JSON, faster to parse, lighter, supports more data types than JSON
- MongoDB stores data in BSON (not human readable), view in JSON.
