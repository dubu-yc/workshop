Aggregation Framework
- another way to query data in MongoDB
- use .aggregate instead of .find
- you can calculate
- pipeline: 2 filters are match stage ($match) and project stage ($project)
- can compute, reshape, and organize data
- $group: an operator that takes the incoming stream of data and siphons it into multiple distinct reservoirs
- non-filtering stages don't modify original data (instead work with the data in the cursor)

Cursor Methods
- sort()
- limit()
- pretty()
- count()
- do the find() method first then cursor.___()
- can be increasing/decreasing direction
- limit() without sort() might miss some data
- cursor.limit().sort() is the same as cursor.sort().limit()

Indexes
- make queries more efficient
- in a database - special data structure that stores a small portion of the collection's data set in an easy to transverse form aka a data structure that optimizes queries

Data Modeling
- a way to organize fields in a document to support your application performance and querying capabilities
- data is stored in the way that it is used
- data that is used together should be stored together
- evolving application implies an evolving data model

Upsert
- everything in MQL that is used to locate a doc in a collection can also be used to modify this document
- db.collection.updateOne({<query to locate>},{<update>})
- hybrid of update and insert
- should only be used when it is needed
- db.collection.updateOne({<query},{<update>},{"upsert":true})
- default is false
- if upsert is true, ask if there is a match
- make sure that the document has the same or similar form to other documents in the collection
- use for conditional updates
